## Project Overview

The **Demand Forecasting for E-Commerce** project is designed to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts product demand based on historical sales data and key performance indicators (KPIs) from Google Analytics. The goal is to assist e-commerce businesses in optimizing inventory levels, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction by anticipating future product demand.

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**

   - Gathered historical sales data and KPIs, including clicks and impressions, from Google Analytics to form a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data, addressing missing values and inconsistencies to ensure high-quality input for the model.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, seasonality, and correlations between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering:**

   - Created new features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities, such as lag features, moving averages, and seasonality indicators.
   - Selected relevant features based on domain knowledge and statistical significance to improve model accuracy.
4. **Model Development:**

   - Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including:
     - **Time Series Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA
     - **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and reduce forecasting errors.
5. **Model Evaluation:**

   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess accuracy and reliability.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets in a ratio of 0.8 : 0.1 : 0.1 for robust evaluation.
6. **Data Visualization:**

   - Created visualizations to illustrate trends, seasonality, and model performance using Matplotlib.
   - Generated plots to compare actual vs. predicted values, providing insights into model effectiveness.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
